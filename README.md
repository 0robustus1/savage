**s**a**v**a**g**e is a dsl for svg. A dsl (domain specific language) takes a
domain and allows the developer to write a program/definition with words and
syntax from that domain. As clojure provides a real nice macro system (as only
Lisp's make it possible) it is quite easy to build complex domain specific
languages here. However this dsl is a little different.  It does not only allow
you to write a *svg* in clojure code but also allows you to make reference
which were not possible before (because a svg-document does not really have a
sense of variables and objects).
